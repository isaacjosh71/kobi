## Architecture & State Management
Architecture: Modular clean folder structure:

/models, /screens, /widgets, /cubit,

State Management: Cubit via flutter_bloc

Navigation: Platform-aware back behavior using Platform.isIOS

Responsiveness: flutter_screenutil ensures layout scales across mobile/tablet

Animations: AnimatedOpacity, Hero, and flutter_staggered_animations for visual polish

## API Simulation

Transactions are loaded from a local JSON file:
assets/transactions.json

Monthly filtering logic via dropdown:

All April May

Each transaction includes:

ID, title, subtitle, amount, category, date, status

## Visuals: Chart + Filters

Donut Pie Chart:

Built using fl_chart

Colors mapped to specific categories (e.g. subscription, music)

Rotates based on current filter:

"All" â†’ 180Â°

"April" â†’ 90Â°

"May" â†’ 270Â°

Legend:

Dynamically built under chart using Wrap

Matches slice colors with categories

Total Expense Display:

Dynamically calculated and centered in chart

Tab Filtering:

Dropdown menu replaces toggle

Tabs: All, April, May â€” triggers Cubit filter update
